# Capstone Project: NYC-311 Service Requests Analysis.

### Project Overview.
A NYC-311 service request is a request for the City to provide assistance, perform an inspection, or address a problem. NYC-311 is a public service with the intent of expanding access to resources, but is this access expanded equally? By analysing over 2 million service requests and measures like poverty rate and racial diversity index, I want to find the relationship between resolution times and demographic indicators, to see if these are somehow predictors for how quick a service request will be solved.

### Data Science solution and impact.
The proposed data science solution is the use of a regression model to predict the resolution time of a specific service request; the expectation is that request type, location and demographics will be predictors of how long this will take. In addition to increasing public awareness by showing the likelihood of an issue to occur on a specific location in NYC, this analysis will help identify biases and logistical issues within the government agencies responsible for solving these requests. There are documented issues regarding the [cost of a NYC-311 request](https://www.governing.com/archive/gt-cities-aim-to-cut-311-costs.html), with New York City's cost per call being [$2.57](https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2010/03/02/final-311-report-030210.pdf). Identifying biases and logistical inefficiencies will lead to shortening delays of request resolutions, in turn reducing the costs incurred by the city and  its taxpayers.

### Dataset description.
The main dataset I will be using is the ["311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present"](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9/about_data) dataset from NYC OpenData. This dataset contains all 311 Service Requests from 2010 to present, and it's updated daily. Additional datasets used are the [racial diversity index](https://app.coredata.nyc/?mlb=false&ntii=pop_race_div_idx&ntr=Sub-Borough%20Area&mz=14&vtl=https%3A%2F%2Fthefurmancenter.carto.com%2Fu%2Fnyufc%2Fapi%2Fv2%2Fviz%2F98d1f16e-95fd-4e52-a2b1-b7abaf634828%2Fviz.json&mln=true&mlp=false&mlat=40.729123&nty=2021&mb=roadmap&pf=%7B%22subsidies%22%3Atrue%7D&md=table&mlv=false&mlng=-73.992714&btl=Borough&atp=neighborhoods) and [poverty rate](https://app.coredata.nyc/?mlb=false&ntii=pop_pov_pct&ntr=Sub-Borough%20Area&mz=14&vtl=https%3A%2F%2Fthefurmancenter.carto.com%2Fu%2Fnyufc%2Fapi%2Fv2%2Fviz%2F98d1f16e-95fd-4e52-a2b1-b7abaf634828%2Fviz.json&mln=true&mlp=false&mlat=40.729123&nty=2021&mb=roadmap&pf=%7B%22subsidies%22%3Atrue%7D&md=table&mlv=false&mlng=-73.992714&btl=Borough&atp=neighborhoods) distributions from NYU's Furman Center, [median household income](https://simplemaps.com/city/new-york/zips/income-household-median) distribution by ZIP code from simplemaps, and the ["NYC Community Boards"](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Community-Boards/ruf7-3wgc/about_data) dataset from NYC OpenData. Columns from these datasets will be used to get a better picture of the location where the 311 requests where made from and extract valuable indicators related to the request's resolution time, if any.
